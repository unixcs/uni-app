# ADR Format

ADRs live in `docs/adr/` and use sequential numbering: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, etc. Create the `docs/adr/` directory lazily — only when the first ADR is needed.

## Template

```md
# {Short title of the decision}
{1-3 sentences: what's the context, what did we decide, and why.}
```

That's it. An ADR can be a single paragraph. The value is in recording that a decision was made and why — not in filling out sections.

## Optional sections
Only include these when they add genuine value. Most ADRs won't need them.
- **Status** frontmatter (`proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN`)
- **Considered Options**
- **Consequences**

## Numbering
Scan `docs/adr/` for the highest existing number and increment by one.

## When to offer an ADR
All three of these must be true:
1. Hard to reverse
2. Surprising without context
3. The result of a real trade-off

If a decision is easy to reverse, skip it. If it's not surprising, nobody will wonder why. If there was no real alternative, there's nothing to record beyond the obvious choice.
